    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Hi, I am Amarachi Okereke</h3>
    <p>I am a professional dressmaker, combining that with AltSchool.
        <br>
        I joined AltSchool because I wanted to diversify and increase my knowledge in technology (They say no knowledge is a waste).
    <br>
    AltSchool ID - ALT/SOE/023/2517
    <br>
    I feel like I am still figuring out so much with my life, so, it is one step at a time
    </p>
